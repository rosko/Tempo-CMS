		<div class="content"> 
		  <h1>[in] Business</h1>
		  <p>This is my third design for www.oswd.org. My last design
		      was downloaded so many times that I wanted to make another one
		    along the same lines. This is another business themed layout that could
		      just as easily be used for a personal blog site.</p>
		  <p>This design was made using <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> and
		    does not use any tables because it has no tabular data. The site
		     is valid <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">CSS</a> and
		     valid <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">XHTML
		     1.0 strict</a>.</p>
		  <div class="p1">Tables are dead, CSS is what is intended for layouts and
		    design, tables are for containing data. CSS uses less code, meaning
		    your site loads quicker, which is great for search engines and people
		    with slow internet connections.</div>
		  <h1><strong> TESTED IN:</strong></h1>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Opera 7.54u1</li>
	        <li>Internet Explorer 6.0.290..</li>
		    <li>Firefox 1.0.6</li>
		    <li>Opera 8.0</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>The design is fluid, with a fixed-width side-bar. The colours, width,
		    fonts etc can be changed by ammending the attached CSS file.</p>
